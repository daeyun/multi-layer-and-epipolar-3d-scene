In ICCV 2019

Project website: https://research.dshin.org/iccv19/multi-layer-depth/

In this project, we perform 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes given a single RGB image as input.

Code and pretrained weights and dataset coming very soon! In the meantime, if you'd like access to the raw codebase or our dataset, please email daeyuns at uci.edu
